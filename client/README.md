Modern SaaS Authentication Flow with WhatsApp OTP üöÄ
This project is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate a modern, secure, and user-friendly authentication flow suitable for today's SaaS products. It replaces traditional email/password logins with a seamless, passwordless system using One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent via WhatsApp.

The entire user interface is built with a mobile-first, responsive design approach using React and Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations powered by Framer Motion. The backend is a robust Node.js and Express API that integrates with Twilio for WhatsApp messaging and MongoDB for data persistence.

‚ú® Project Highlights
Stunning UI/UX: A visually engaging interface with gradient backgrounds, modern fonts, and fluid animations to create a professional user experience.

Passwordless Authentication: Secure, passwordless login using One-Time Passwords (OTP) sent directly to the user's WhatsApp, enhancing both security and convenience.

Smart User Flow: The application intelligently distinguishes between new and existing users after OTP verification, directing them to either a registration form or their personalized home page.

Animated Splash Screen: A beautiful, animated welcome screen that provides an engaging entry point to the application.

Personalized Welcome: Registered users are greeted with a personalized, animated welcome message on the home page.

Responsive Design: The UI is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Modular & Scalable Codebase: The project is structured with a clear separation between the frontend and backend, using modern JavaScript (ESM) and a modular component-based architecture.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x or higher)

npm (or yarn)

MongoDB (a local instance or a free cloud instance from MongoDB Atlas)

A Twilio account with WhatsApp Sandbox configured.

1. Backend Setup
   First, let's get the server running.

Bash

# 1. Navigate to the backend directory

cd backend

# 2. Install the required dependencies

npm install

# 3. Create an environment file from the example

# On Windows: copy .env.example .env

# On macOS/Linux: cp .env.example .env

Now, open the newly created .env file and add your credentials:

backend/.env

Code snippet

# MongoDB Connection String

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Server Port

PORT=8080

# Twilio Credentials

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886 # Twilio's sandbox number 2. Frontend Setup
Next, set up the React client.

Bash

# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder

cd frontend

# 2. Install the required dependencies

npm install

# 3. Create a local environment file from the example

# On Windows: copy .env.local.example .env.local

# On macOS/Linux: cp .env.local.example .env.local

The .env.local file tells your frontend where to find the backend API. The default is already set up for local development.

frontend/.env.local

Code snippet

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
You will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminal windows.

Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server

Bash

cd backend
node index.js
You should see MongoDB Connected! and Server running on port 8080 in the console.

Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Development Server

Bash

cd frontend
npm run dev
Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port).

You can now use the application!
